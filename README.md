Countdown
=========

A game implemented in C giving you 6 numbers(natural integers!) in the following list, with equal odds of being
randomly chosen: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100. They can all appear more than once.
You can only use a number once.
A total is also randomly generated, a number between 100 and 999, both included.
You have 30 secs to find the result, starting when the total is displayed.
You can use +-*/ (no negative numbers, no decimals, ony natural integers operations).

Finishing before the 30 seconds doesn't matter, what matter is finding the result or getting as close as possible from it.

Once the 30 secs are over, you are either desplayed a solution to find the result or, when no result can be found with 
the given numbers, a solution to get to the closest result from the total.

Have fun!
